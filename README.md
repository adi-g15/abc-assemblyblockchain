Assembly Block Chain

This is a "To Be Developed" repositories. It just clicked to create it, just as a fun activity, no particular goal here, but does have a plan.


## Initial Plan

* Write data structure and complex part in Rust/C++. Use linker to link with simpler assembly code, the calling preferably done by assembly code
  * **Why not write in a single language?** - Well, I don't know assembly much to the level to maintain complex data structures, or even simpler ones. Secondly, I won't be writing all in Rust/C++, because 'I want it to be' in Assembly in future. (Again, no goal)
  * Maybe a big endeavour, don't do it all at a time, follow your do what interests strategy
* Use the consensus algorithm discussed in the externship
* The nodes in the network will be considered IoT devices, so not all nodes will be full nodes
* OPTIONALLY - DONT DO THIS INITIALLY, ADDS UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY, CAN SKIP TOO - Another blockchain that has the UIDs, like in the paper [Ensuring Proof-of-Authenticityof IoT Edge Devices using Blockchain Technology](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~uguin/pdfs/Blockchain-2018.pdf)
* OPTIONALLY - DONT DO THIS INITIALLY, ADDS COMPLEXITY - Add smart concepts, now this likely involves using another language, Firstly, write code in Rust/C++ not in assembly for the smart contracts. Secondly, since another language maybe concerned, chose a simpler one, even if you end up chosing javascript with the whole v8 engine, what matters is the idea not the size, optimise later
* OPTIONALLY - DONT DO THIS INITIALLY, ADDS COMPLEXITY - (Initially, allow only 'to the blockchain', not the retrieving data part, as that requires the smart contracts)Use the sidechain concept mentioned in [Blockchain, IoT and Sidechains](http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2019/IMECS2019_pp136-140.pdf)


## When will I do it

Maybe will start in this month itself. So already left notes for me.
Made this a **public repo** not private, since the initial plan part seems very interesting to me, maybe someone finds the same interest in that :D.

Unlicense License, as mentioned it is a fun activity, fork do whatever you want with the code (when it has some ðŸ˜…)
